On BDD
======

Behaviour-driven development is such a good approach to maintain a
plain workflow, wasting the time with what really matter: *business
value*.

The common TDD_ approach, consists basically in writing unit tests,
run, make it fail, write code, make it run, make it green. This is
such a awesome practice, since you can build really trustable code,
without wondering what can happen in the future of the project, thus
creating a huge amount of code that doesn't make sense.  Aditionally,
next steps use to be: do the same thing with functional, integration
and acceptance tests.

Nevertheless, BDD_ brings new perspectives to you, one of them is the
outside-in testing development. With this approach you can build your
software starting with the most external layer, and go deeper until
reach unitary tests.

Introducing Lettuce
===================

Lettuce is a quite simple tool, it is mostly based on Cucumber_, which
is a honking great tool, and has a lot more features than Lettuce.

Although Lettuce aims on the most usual tasks on BDD_, specially
focusing on those that make BDD_ be so fun :)


Quick start
===========

This documentation will drive you through all the Lettuce features.
When you feel a bit comfortable, go to the :ref:`first part of the tutorial <tutorial-simple>`, or go further on the :ref:`reference <reference-features>`.
