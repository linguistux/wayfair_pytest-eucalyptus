## On release names

Lettuce release names will be inspired by any green stuff.

Barium: In form of "barium nitrate" is commonly used to make green fireworks. Such a good name for a first version :)

# What

Lettuce is a BDD tool for python, 100% inspired on [cucumber](http://cukes.info/ "BDD with elegance and joy").

# Motivation

1. Testing must be funny and easy
2. Most python developers code in python
3. I love python, and ever did. But I also ever missed something that make writing tests easier and funnier.
4. I like [nose](http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/) which is has pythonic set of tools, and I like it, althrough as the project I am working on grows, tests grows as well, and become harder to understand.
5. [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) makes [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) even more sexy. Python is sexy too.
