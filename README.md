# What

Lettuce is a BDD tool for python, 100% inspired on [cucumber](http://cukes.info/ "BDD with elegance and joy").

# Motivation

1. I love python, and ever did. But I also ever missed something that make writing tests easier and funnier.
2. I like [nose](http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/) which is has pythonic set of tools, and I do like it, althrough as the project I am working on grows, tests grows as well, and become harder to understand.
3. [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) makes [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) even more sexy. I needed to try this for Python.
